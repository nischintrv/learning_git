**Delays:**

1. **Analyze Days_Taken:** Identify the top 3-5 invoices with delays exceeding 5 days (pending or processed). This will help pinpoint problematic areas.
	* Investigate INV_044 (2769.84), INV_053 (2490.34) and INV_054 (3056.32) as potential candidates.
2. **Improve Processing Efficiency:** Review the workflow and streamline it to reduce processing time for each invoice.
3. **Automate Notifications:** Set up automated email notifications for both assignees and approvers when an invoice is pending or overdue, ensuring timely follow-up.

**Workload:**

1. **Balance Workload Distribution:** Analyze invoices assigned to each account (acctnt_1 to acctnt_6) and redistribute them to maintain a balanced workload.
	* Assign more invoices to underutilized accounts like acctnt_2 and acctnt_3.
	* Reassign tasks from overloaded accounts, such as acctnt_1 and acctnt_4.
2. **Monitor Progress:** Regularly track the progress of each assignee and adjust their workload accordingly.
3. **Provide Training or Support:** Offer training or support to employees who are struggling with their assigned workload or need assistance in managing their tasks.

**Actionable Steps:**

1. Implement a workflow automation tool to streamline processing and reduce manual intervention.
2. Establish clear goals, deadlines, and expectations for each assignee to ensure they understand the importance of meeting targets.
3. Schedule regular team meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and make adjustments as needed.

By implementing these improvements, you can minimize delays and ensure a more even distribution of workload among assigned employees.
